## Agile/SCRUM

[Adapted from Wikipedia - The free Ecyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

In software development, agile (sometimes written Agile) practices approach discovering requirements and developing solutions through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. Their customer(s)/end user(s) play a pivotal role in the work process and are involved in reviews at regular intervals. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.

## How it works

- items are reported as **issues**
- points and meta data are assigned to items as **labels**
- **milestones** are used to group issues in sprints

## 1. Create issues as backlog items

To create a new backlog item, just create a new issue.

Once a new issue has been created, assign it the right labels and/or assign it to a sprint (milestone).

Issues allow you to have a conversation about the item and even allow you to create task lists inside the issue using [GitHub's markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## 2. Add labels to issues

Add the following labels to your repository:

### Priorities

`priority` labels allow you to prioritize items in your backlog e.g.:

- `priority: lowest`
- `priority: low`
- `priority: medium`
- `priority: high`
- `priority: highest`

### Points

`point` labels allow you to assign velocity points to individual items (issues) e.g. using [Fibonacci numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number):

- `point: 1`
- `point: 2`
- `point: 3`
- `point: 5`
- `point: 8`
- `point: 13`
- `point: 21`

### Types

`type` labels allow you to easily filter items (issues) in the dashboard e.g.:

- `type:bug`: bug
- `type:chore`: chore, maintenance work
- `type:feature`: new feature
- `type:infrastructure`: infrastructure related
- `type:performance`: performance related
- `type:refactor`: refactor
- `type:test`: test related

### Other

You can define and assign custom labels that you need within your workflow or organization.

## 3. Define sprints as milestones

You can create a milestone for every sprint and add items (issues) from the backlog to a milestone.

This allows you to group items in sprints and track them by milestone in your [issue dashboard](https://github.com/issues).

The backlog then consists of all items (issues) that have no `milestone` attached to it.

**TIP**: Use `no:milestone` in the search field on your [issue dashboard](https://github.com/issues) to find backlog items.
