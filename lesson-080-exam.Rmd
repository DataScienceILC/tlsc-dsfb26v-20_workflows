## Details on exam for this course
As explained, the course will be completed with an assessment on your portfolio. The portfolio needs to be hosted on a publicly accessible Gihub pages website. During a live assessment, the teacher and you will go over the portfolio together. The idea is that you provide clarifications on any questions that might arise from your portfolio. Two teachers will be present during this assessment.

## Assessment duration
The assessment will be planned during a 20 minutes online video call. Enabling your camera during this call is obligatory. The call will start on the planned time, so be there on time. Showing up too late in the call without further notice will fail you the assessment. In case you fail the assessment, a new assessment will be planned as a do-over. If you fail that do-over again, we will register a 'fail' for the course.

## Portfolio ready before assessment
Make sure that you have shared the public weblink to your portfolio **at least 3 days before the planned assessment**. WE need to have some time in advance to prepare. If, for some reason, you cannot make this deadline, let us know.

## Getting help
We are here to help you pass this course! If you need assistence on getting your portfolio in order, please let us know. We do not have all the answers though, sometimes we will merely be able to point you in a solutions direction. You can get help also on fora, either on public fora such as Stack Overflow. Or on the course forum on Canvas. I can highly recommend posing a question on Stack Overflow yourself. If you stick to the forum rules, you will find that there are a lot of friendly fellow-programmers willing to aid you in your programming quest.
