## Introduction

Plain text is a great way to write information down. Plain text has some major advantages:

- Works regardless of what time you're trying to read the file, i.e. computers have and will continue to speak plain text
- Works perfectly with version control software like git. 
- Easy to read, easy to write

Markdown is a plain text format that allows for common typesetting features including:

- Text formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
- Links
- Tables
- In-line images

Without the need for spending time typesetting which is tedious and usually unnecessary. So if we want those kinds of things, we might want to use Markdown.

RMarkdown allows us to produce an output document (PDF, DOCX, website) based upon a mix of Markdown and R code.
This lets us write analyses in R as we already do but also write our reports/papers/etc. in R.
Instead of the usual loop:

- Run analysis
- Edit/update report
- Commit changes to Git-repository
- Push to Github

The loop becomes:

- Edit RMarkdown doc
- Commit changes to Git-repository
- Push to Github

This workflow fits in a 'continuous integration' workflow

## Learning Outcomes

- Gain an awareness of Markdown and RMarkdown
- Author a simple RMarkdown document in RStudio

## RMarkdown Principles:

### Chunks

Chunks take options, see: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/

#### Echo and Include {-}

When writing a report, it's common to not want the R code to actually show up in the final document.
Use the `echo` chunk option to do this:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```
or if you want the code to run but not show anything, use `include`

```{r, include = FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```

#### Eval {-}

Sometimes you may just want to show some R code with nice syntax highlighting but not evaluate it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
will_it_eval <- "eval?"
```

#### Cache {-}

If you know a chunk will not need to change as other parts of the document are knitted, you can cache a chunk that contains a potentially long-running or slow command or commands:


```{r, cache=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() # Some really slow plot
```

### Inline expressions in prose

You can include inline r-code in this way:

`r 2+2`

It evaluates to: `r 2+2`

### Plots

Base graphics: Just run `plot(1:10)`
ggplot2: Run `ggplot(...))`

Customize output sizing with chunk options: `fig.width`, `fig.height`, `dpi`, `out.width`

### Tables

If you search around, there are tons of ways to do this. The most basic way and the way I almost always use is with the `kable` function from the `knitr` package:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data("mpg")
knitr::kable(head(mpg))
```

or an interactive table
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data("mpg")
DT::datatable(head(mpg))
```

## Output formats

RMarkdown documents can be converted into many formats, most often:

- PDF
- HTML
- Microsoft Word
- ioslides
- beamer

See more info here: http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html

You can specifically choose which output format to render to with the RStudio "Knit" button in the toolbar, or with:

```
rmarkdown::render(...)
```

We can control which output format(s) knitting will produce and even customize the options for each format separately.
To customize each output format, change the YAML frontmatter:

e.g. customize HTML and PDF output

```
---
title: "My document"
output:
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
  pdf_document:
    fig_caption: false
---

```

## LaTeX
You can write formulas in RMarkdown using LaTeX
The formula for a straigth line with slope `a` and intercept `b`

$Yi = aXi + b$

To build more complex formula's you can use an online LaTeX . See 


## Including images

There are basically three ways to include an image from an existing file:

 1. In an RMarkdown code chunk
 1. As a direct link to an image file with the `![caption](link)` tag
 1. From embedded html code

### In an R-chunk call
You can use the function from `{knitr}` `include_graphics()`

Displays
```{r, dpi=300, fig.cap="'Optimus Prime'; Leader of the Autobots"}
knitr::include_graphics(
  here::here(
    "images",
    "prime.jpeg"
  )
)
```

The advantage of this approach is that you can use all the chunk options for this code chunk, controlling e.g. the size and behavior of the image as you would normally do for a code-generated graphs. Setting the `dpi` option in the code chunk controls the size of the image displayed in the rendered output. To see more options run `?knitr::include_graphics()` in the R console. 

If you would like to use the above chunk option -- I personally prefer this option because it is an R only solution -- you should know about the `{captioner}` package. This package helps you with numbering tables and figures and with it you can create standardized captions, or add captions to your figures from another source file. A good workflow would be to write all captions in a separate text file and add them to your R Markdown document using the `{captioner}`package. In this way you can more easily edit and revise captions separate from the main text. For more info on [`{captioner}`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/captioner/vignettes/using_captioner.html)   

### 2. We can also use Markdown syntax like this
See [this blog](https://medium.com/markdown-monster-blog/getting-images-into-markdown-documents-and-weblog-posts-with-markdown-monster-9ec6f353d8ec) for more details

```
![Megatron-Leader of the Decepticons](./images/megatron.jpeg){ width=20%}
```
Note that the path name is not a string

!['Megatron'; Leader of the Decepticons](./images/megatron.jpeg){ width=20%}

Setting `{ width=x%}` is a special control for Pandoc, which is the engine that converts RMarkdown to plain Markdown. This does not work for all Markdown dialects.

The advantage of this approach is that it is written very fast. You can also include an image from a web url like this

```
![My personal favorite; 'Soundwave'](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/transformers/images/8/89/Transformers_G1_Soundwave.jpg)
```

![My personal favorite; 'Soundwave'](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/transformers/images/8/89/Transformers_G1_Soundwave.jpg)

### 3. You can also include a local (or web url linked) image using html.

```
<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/transformers/images/b/bf/Perceptorg1.jpg"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 20px;" />
```

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/transformers/images/b/bf/Perceptorg1.jpg"
     alt="Markdown Monster icon"
     style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />

The advantage of this latter option is obviously that you can tweak the apperance and the behavior of your image far better using embedded html. The disadvantge might be that you would have to learn html. This however is a very good idea if you intend to become a Data Scientist/Bioinformatician.

## Summary

- Markdown is a simple plain text format suitable for authoring rich documents
- RMarkdown is a slight extention of the Markdown syntax that lets us mix code and prose together
- RMarkdown is a key part of the R reproducible science scene
- RStudio is a great way to author RMarkdown documents
- Later on in this workshop, we'll see how to deal with citations so we can write academic manuscripts

### <mark>**EXERCISE 1; Create a short report**</mark> {-}

 1. Find a relevant dataset  that you recently found or are busy with at the moment*
 1. Write a short Rmd report where you LOAD and VISUALIZE (create at least 3 different graphs) the data in an Rmd report.
 1. Publish the exploratory analysis in your portfolio
 
*If you do nog have a dataset, you can use this one:
"./data/API_AG.LND.FRST.K2_DS2_en_csv_v2_716262"

**Place it on you github (portfolio) repo and send me the link.**


## Setting up a bookdown project and publishing it online as course portfolio {#bookdownportfolio}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Lesson aim
After this lesson you will be able to

 1. Setup github pages
 1. Create a bookdown project
 1. Render a bookdown project to a local website
 1. Add the rendered site to your github pages
 
## Github pages
Each account on github can be associated to one or multiple websites that are hosted on Github.com. To setup a website on Github (also called `github-pages` or `gh-pages`), we need to create a repository with a special name. For this course we will require you to upload results from the exercises and assignments results to you personal github pages. **This is a hard requirement for passing this course. If you have no or an empty portfolio, you cannot pass this course**

<div class="question">
##### Exercise 4.0

 1. Execute the steps explained [here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) to setup a github-pages repository called `workflows-portfolio`
 1. Send the url to your public portfolio address to the teachers by personal chat.

## Bookdown
The `{bookdown}` R package is basically a collection of RMarkdown files, collated into a website with nice formatting and the possibility to cross reference and add citations and visualizations. The author of the bookdown is also the main author of `{knitr}`.    

## A simple bookdown example
To start with bookdown, there is a [good and free resource available](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html). 

## Transform your current portfolio project to a bookdown site
By now you should have collected several Rmd files for completing the exercises and assignments in the course thusfar. If everything went well, you have these files collected in your portfolio RStudio project, linked to a Github repo.
To start building your bookdown project, use the minimal example you have seen above. Start by rendering your project using `bookdown::render()`. To the very least you should have an index.html file that contains the yaml definitions for your bookdown project. You can arrange the chapters by using an index in every Rmd file. Use indexes like `001_<file_name>.Rmd`. When you want to add a chapter in between two chapters, this makes it easier. to achieve this.

## Render the book locally
When you have build your `index.Rmd` file and have collected all files in the root of your project, be sure all depending data, scripts and other files such as images etc. are also present in the project. Use the guerrilla analytics logic to setup the project structure. Set the option `new_session: yes` in your `_bookdown.yml` or `index.Rmd` file. This prevent problems down the line. Render the book until all errors are solved. You can debud each file and error by looking at the line numbers where the rendering is causing problems.


## Hosting the bookdown project in your github pages

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON CONFIDENTIALITY**

<mark>**When hosting you portfolio on a public web address, please make sure that there is no confidential information visable in your project. Data that falls under a non-disclosure agreement for example from your projecticum may not be shared. Also, be sure not to publish any personal secrets such as passwords and tokens, inside a github repo or webpage.**</mark> 

Once you have sucefully rendered your bookdown to a full website, hosting can be achived by copying all html files to your Github-pages. The easiest way is to clone your github pages repo and add, commit and push all html files to your github pages repo. The website will be automatically updated after some time. You can also setup a theme for your github pages. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-with-the-theme-chooser) for more info.

For a complete manual on working with github pages, [see the gh-pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/getting-started-with-github-pages) 

If you want to go for a full continuous integration workflow (which is highly recommended), you can follow these steps in [this blog](https://medium.com/@delucmat/how-to-publish-bookdown-projects-with-github-actions-on-github-pages-6e6aecc7331e)
