In part two of this lesson you learned how to use Git if you are the only person working on a project. However, often you are **working together with other persons**. Git offers some additional tools to promote collaboration. We will introduce these additional tools in this part.

**before you do anything, make a local backup of your github repositories now**
Most likely, you will have the local clone(s) on your computer. Just backup this folder. 
Github collaborating can be tricky and you will be messing around in github today. While you can most of the time recover previous work, you will want to have the peace of mind that you won't lose anything while learning. This gives you the opportunity to really try and see what happens if you mess things up while working with 2 people on the same repo, and see if you can fix it. We mean it, try to break stuff! We are here now to help you fix it, and you have the time now to learn. You don't want to have your first github mess-up when working on a deadline in your internship...

## The extended Git workflow: branching & merging

Suppose Bas and Marc are working together on a (data analysis) project. For this project, Bas created one shared Git repository on GitHub in which Bas and Marc can store the scripts for the project. Bas and Marc both cloned this repository to their laptops. Every now and then Bas and Marc make changes to the scripts. You can imagine that this may go wrong: Bas and Marc are both adding/deleting things from the Git repository at the same time from different computers and this can result in conflicts. For example, Bas may decide to add an extra line to script1 and commit/push the changes to GitHub. Marc, who still works on the old version, then removes some lines from script1. When Marc now commits/pushes the changes to GitHub an error will occur, because Marc's changes are not in line with Bas' changes. 

Clearly, if you are working together with other persons, the workflow presented previously is too simple and can give rise to conflicts. Fortunately, Git offers additional tools for working together. The most important tool is a branch. A **branch** can be seen as a development environment in Git in which you store your commits. When you create a Git repository in GitHub, you automatically create one branch, the **main branch**. In the default state, you store all commits in this main branch. If you are working with multiple persons on the same project, it is best practice to have a **development branch** for each person. You can create such a development branch anytime during the project. When you create a development branch, you basically create a copy of the main branch (you 'branch off') in which you can work without affecting the content of the main branch. In this development branch you can commit/push as you normally would do in the main branch. After you made your changes and you know that the scripts are working as expected, you can add your changes to the main branch by **merging** your development branch with the main branch. You can most easily perform this merge on GitHub (where it is called a **pull request**), because of GitHub's user-friendly interface. After that, you can pull the updates in the main branch to your computer. 

In summary, the workflow for projects with multiple persons consists of the following steps:

1. The person that wants to make some changes to the project, creates a development branch. 
1. This person can then make changes, commit the changes and pushes them to GitHub. 
1. On GitHub, the person can create a pull request to add his changes to the main branch. 
1. All the team members can now pull the changes to their computer.

Below, we will explain these steps in detail and we will show how you can perform the steps in RStudio and GitHub.

## The extended Git workflow in RStudio and GitHub

### Creating a new development environment (branching)

If you are committing your changes to the Git repository, the default is to commit the changes to the main branch. If you are in RStudio, you can easily see on which branch you are working by checking the Git menu:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='The main branch in RStudio.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_1_mainbranch.png')
```

You can create a development branch by clicking on the purple 'New Branch' symbol in the Git menu: 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Create a new branch in RStudio.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_2_newbranch.png')
```

Make sure that you pull once before creating your development branch, to make sure that your main branch is up to date. You can pull using the blue, downward pointing pull arrow in the Git menu. Once you click on the 'New Branch' symbol, a new menu will open. In this menu, you can choose the name for your development branch. For the other options, you can accept the default settings (see figure below). 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Branch menu in RStudio.', out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_3_newbranch2.png')
```

After creating the development branch, you can see that you automatically switched from the main branch to the newly created development branch. 

### Saving a new version of your files (commit and push)

Now that you are on the new development branch, you can start changing files. After you made your changes, you can commit your changes and push the changes to GitHub as explained in the previous section. You can also see the changes you made in GitHub by selecting the correct branch. You can do this in the 'code' menu of your repository:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Branch menu in GitHub.', out.width='40%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_4_branchesGitHub.png')
```

### Creating and resolving a pull request on GitHub

Once you finished making your changes, you can add the changes to the main branch. The most easy way to do this is to create a pull request on GitHub. On the GitHub website you can go to the pull request menu:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Pull request menu in GitHub (1).'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_5_pullrequest.png')
```

Usually, you will see a message in this menu that states that your development branch had some recent pushes. You can then click on the 'Compare and pull request' button. If this message is not visible, you can click on the 'New pull request' button. In both cases, you will go to a new page that looks like this:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Pull request menu in GitHub (2).', out.width='60%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_6_pullrequest2.png')
```

Here, you have to check if the branches that are going to be merged, are correct. In this case it is correct: the development branch 'Bas3' will be merged into the main branch. GitHub also checks for you if there will be any conflicts when merging. If everyone in your team follows the workflow as indicated in this lesson, there will rarely be conflicts. If everything is OK, you can create the pull request by clicking on the 'Create pull request' button. 

After you created the pull request, you will be automatically guided to the page where you can resolve the merge request:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Resolve pull request in GitHub (1).', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_7_pullrequest3.png')
```

Click on 'Merge pull request' and subsequently on 'Confirm merge'. If the merge was successful, you will see the following:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Resolve pull request in GitHub (2).', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_8_pullrequest4.png')
```

You can now delete the development branch from GitHub by clicking 'Delete branch'. 

### Downloading the changes to your local repository (pull)

Your Git repository on GitHub is now up to date again, but the main branch of your local Git repository (on your laptop) still needs to be updated. For this, you first switch to the main branch using the Git menu in RStudio:

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='The main branch in RStudio.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/lesson23_1_mainbranch.png')
```

Then you pull the changes from GitHub to your local Git repository using the blue, downward pointing arrow in the GitHub menu. 

### Deleting the local development branch

You have updated the Git repository on GitHub and on your laptop. You have also removed the development branch from GitHub. However, the branch is still present on your laptop. You can remove the branch by opening the Terminal in RStudio and typing the command `git branch -d Bas3` (of course you have to use the name of your development branch instead of 'Bas3').

The circle is closed: you have made some changes to the project using a development branch and merged this branch into the main branch. If you want to make some new changes, you can create a new branch and follow the same steps for these new changes.

##### Exercise `r les` {-}

Use the Git repository that you created in the first exercise of the the last lesson. (the repository with the markdown file). 

a) Create a new branch in RStudio. 
b) Modify the markdown file by adding some additional text. Save the changes and commit/push the changes to GitHub. Go to GitHub and try to find the commits of the new branch. 
c) In RStudio, change to the main branch. What happens to your recent changes in your RMarkdown file? What happens if you change to your development branch?
d) Merge your changes with the main branch by creating and resolving a pull request. In RStudio, switch to the main branch and pull your changes. Does the RMarkdown file now have the changes?
e) Delete the local development branch using the command line.

c) The changes disappear, because the changes are only present in the development branch and not in the main branch. If you go back to your development branch, the content reappears.
d) After resolving the pull request on GitHub and pulling the changes to your computer, you should be able to see the file changes in the main branch. 
e) You can delete the branch on your computer using the command `git branch -d <branch-name>`.
